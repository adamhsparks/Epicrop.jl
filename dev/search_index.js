Predefined values for the EPIRICE model can be found in Savary et al. (2012) for the following diseases of rice: bacterial blight, brown spot, leaf blast, sheath blight, tungro. Given other parameters, the model framework is capable of modelling other diseases using the methods as described by Savary et al.
