Runs a healthy-latent-infectious-postinfectious (HLIP) model using weather data and optimal curve values for respective crop diseases.

# Keywords
- `wth` a data frame of weather on a daily time-step containing data with the following field names.
    | Field | value |
    |-------|-------------|
    |YYYYMMDD | Date as Year Month Day, YYYY-MM-DD, (ISO8601) |
    |DOY |  Consecutive day of year, commonly called "Julian date" |
    |TEMP | Mean daily temperature (Â°C) |
    |RHUM | Mean daily relative humidity (%) |
    |RAIN | Mean daily rainfall (mm) |
- `emergence`: expected date of plant emergence entered as a `Dates.Date` object. From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `onset` expected number of days until the onset of disease after emergence date. From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `duration`: simulation duration (growing season length). From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `rhlim`: threshold to decide whether leaves are wet or not (usually 90%). From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `rainlim`: threshold to decide whether leaves are wet or not. From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `H0`: initial number of plant's healthy sites. From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `I0`: initial number of infective sites. From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `RcA`: crop age modifier for *Rc* (the basic infection rate corrected for removals). From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `RcT`: temperature modifier for *Rc* (the basic infection rate corrected for removals). From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `RcOpt`: potential basic infection rate corrected for removals. From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `i`: duration of infectious period. From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `p`: duration of latent period. From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `Sx`: maximum number of sites. From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `a`: aggregation coefficient. From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `RRS`: relative rate of physiological senescence. From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.
- `RRG`: relative rate of growth. From Table 1 Savary _et al._ 2012.

# Returns
A `DataFrame` with the model's output. Latitude and longitude are included for mapping purposes if they are present in the input weather data.
