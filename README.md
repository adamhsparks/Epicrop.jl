A Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model for plant disease epidemic modeling.
Originally this modelling framework was used by specific disease models in EPIRICE to simulate severity of several rice
diseases (Savary _et al._ 2012).
Given proper values it can be used with other pathosystems as well.
