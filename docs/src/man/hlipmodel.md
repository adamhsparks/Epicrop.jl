# Modelling Disease Epidemics

Epicrop supplies one function, `hlipmodel` that can be used to predict unmanaged plant
disease epidemics.
Predefined values for the EPIRICE model can be found in Savary et al. (2012) for the
following diseases of rice: bacterial blight, brown spot, leaf blast, sheath blight, tungro.
Given other parameters, the model framework is capable of modelling other diseases using the
methods as described by Savary et al. (2012).

# Example Usage

Predict an unmanaged epidemic of brown spot at the International Rice Research Institute
(IRRI) Zeigler Experiment station in Los BaÃ±os, Calabarzon, Philippines.
Weather data will be downloaded from the [NASA POWER](https://power.larc.nasa.gov) API for
use in this example.
To automate this process, you may find the R package,
[nasapower](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nasapower/index.html), useful for
downloading weather data in conjunction with
[RCall](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl).

```@example 1
using Epicrop

using DataFrames

using CSV

w = CSV.read(download("https://power.larc.nasa.gov/api/temporal/daily/point?parameters=PRECTOTCORR,T2M,RH2M&community=ag&start=20100630&end=20101231&latitude=14.6774&longitude=121.25562&format=csv&time_standard=utc&user=Epicropjl"), DataFrame, header = 12)

rename!(w, :RH2M => :RHUM, :T2M => :TEMP, :PRECTOTCORR => :RAIN)

RcA = [0 0.35; 20 0.35; 40 0.35; 60 0.47; 80 0.59; 100 0.71; 120 1]

RcT = [15 0; 20 0.06; 25 1.0; 30 0.85; 35 0.16; 40 0]

bs = hlipmodel(
		wth = w,
		emergence = "2000-07-01",
		onset = 20,
		duration = 120,
		rhlim = 90,
		rainlim = 5,
		H0 = 600,
		I0 = 1,
		RcA = RcA,
		RcT = RcT,
		RcOpt = 0.61,
		p = 6,
		i = 19,
		Sx = 100000,
		a = 1,
		RRS = 0.01,
		RRG = 0.1
)
